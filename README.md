# The Daily Sprint CLI (CRUD app)

The Daily Sprint CLI is a python command-line tool for managing tasks with priority levels.

## Tech Used: 
Python 3.13.7

## Features:
1. Adding a task
2. Searching for a task
3. Viewing all tasks
4. Deleting a task

## Installation:
Clone repo: git clone https://github.com/ImR10/the_daily_sprint_CLI.git  
Navigate to folder: cd the_daily_sprint_CLI  
Run app: python sprint.py

## What I learned:
1. Basic Python syntax (how it differs from Java)
2. Lists and Dictionaries (in this case, a list of dictionaries)
3. For-else loops (else is performed if whole for loop is iterated)

## Future Improvements:
- [ ] Covert logic to functions
- [ ] Covert funcitons into methods - OOP project
